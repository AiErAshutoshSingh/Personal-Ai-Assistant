# Personalized Voice Assistant with GPT and Whisper

## 📜 Description  
This project focuses on developing a personalized and conversational AI voice assistant. By leveraging GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for natural language understanding and **Whisper** for realistic text-to-speech synthesis, the assistant can deliver seamless, intelligent, and human-like interactions. The assistant is designed to adapt to user preferences and deliver a highly personalized experience, suitable for applications in customer service, healthcare, education, and more.

## 🚀 Key Components  
1. **GPT**:  
   - Powered by Generative Pre-trained Transformers, it handles natural language understanding (NLU) and generates intelligent and context-aware responses.  
   - Features include dynamic conversations, intent recognition, and personalized dialogue.  

2. **Whisper**:  
   - Utilized for state-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, creating natural and expressive voice outputs.  
   - Supports multiple languages and tones for diverse user preferences.

3. **Python Integration**:  
   - Acts as the core programming language to integrate and manage the GPT and Whisper APIs.  
   - Ensures modularity, scalability, and easy debugging.
